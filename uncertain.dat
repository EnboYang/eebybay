00480           the visual possible EE is very close to the initial spike
00512           spike is narrow, possible ee is wide
00906           looks like precursor, and have sample leve with spike
00936           precursor
01289           spike followed with a hard pulse and then a soft one
02155           not very clear
03078
03113
03152           contains three pulses
03248
03266           refer to 03152
03294           uncertain
03431
04660           complex structure
05339           complex structure, haven't finished at the end of data!!!!!*
05469
05471           looks like haven't finished
05527           complex
05533           complex
05547           maybe not, a little complex
05711           very like precursor
06144           interesting
06216           complex structure
06343           have a hard precursor
06436           contains three precursors
06535           complex structure,!!!!
06634           not sure precursor or not
06697           a little complex
06824           maybe precursor
07133           complex structure, need cautious!!!
07353           contains couple of pulse
07753           not sure
07793           complex,hist shows three pulses
07813           maybe, but the spike are in same pulse with ee
07912           need more detailed data
08047           complex
